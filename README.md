# colorjoe - The Scaleable Color Picker

colorjoe was somewhat inspired by
[ColorJack](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex11/colorjack/index.htm) and
[RightJS Colorpicker](http://rightjs.org/ui/colorpicker). Unlike those it
actually scales pretty well. Essentially this means that you'll be able to
define its actual dimensions and layout using a bit of CSS. This way the widget
fits well responsive layouts.

In addition it's relatively easy to implement missing functionality (RGB fields,
whatnot) thanks to the simple API it provides.
